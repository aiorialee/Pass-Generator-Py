# Strong-Password-Generator
This Python script is a Stroing-password Generator that leverages Python's random library for generating random characters

##Explain
The program starts by importing the random library. It defines three lists—letters, numbers, and symbols—that serve as the pool of characters from which the password will be generated. The user is then asked to specify how many of each type of character they want in their password.

The program generates the password by randomly selecting characters from these lists and appending them to a 'password_list'.
This list is then shuffled to randomize the order of the characters. Finally, the program concatenates the characters together to form the final password string, which is then displayed to the user.
